# AI Coursework

This repository contains both tasks for the coursework where:

1. **Task 1: Predicting California Housing Prices**  
   Uses linear regression (with both Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent) to predict median house values based on only median income.

2. **Task 2: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using SVM**  
   Applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify smartphone sensor data into two classes (active vs. inactive) derived from the original six activity labels.

## Requirements
- UCI HAR Dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones 
- **Python Version:** Python 3.x  
- **Required Packages:**  
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn

-For task 2 you have to modify line 27 to have your own  file path for the UCI HAR dataset- you can do this by locating where you downloaded the dataset, right clicking the folder "UCI Har dataset" and pressing copy as path, then paste where the original path is in the code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

## Additional notes
This code was only tested using the Spyder environment for the most accurate run of this code use Spyder.
